(Requires no supports to 3D print on typical home FDM printers.)

Attached are the final STL files for top and bottom, and the source files.  Please feel free to do whatever (or nothing) with this!

Note 2:  The lower case is designed for typical 0.2mm layer heights to achieve nice clean screw holes.
